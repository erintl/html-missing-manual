    <p>Apocalypse Today is a world leader in conspiracy theories, dour predictions, and
      panic-spreading. Our motto is "be prepared for every possibility (except for the good ones)."

    <h2>How the World Could End</h2>
    <h3>Scenarios that spell the end of life as we know</h3>
    <p class="byline">by Ray N. Carnation</p>
  </header>

  <p><span class="lead-in">Right now</span>, you're probably feeling pretty good. After all, life in
  the developed world is comfortable<span class="style1">—</span>probably more comfortable than it's
  been for the average human being throughout all of recorded history.</p>

    <figcaption>Will you be the last person standing if one of these apocalyptic scenarios plays
      out?</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>But don't get too smug. There's still plenty of horrific ways it
  could all fall apart. In this article, you'll learn about a few of our
  favorites.</p>

  <h3>Mayan Doomsday</h3>
  <p>Skeptics suggest that the Mayan calendar simply rolls to a new
  5,126-year era after 2012, and doesn't actually predict a life-ending
  apocalypse. But given that the long-dead Mayans were wrong about
  virtually everything else, why should we trust them on this?</p>

  <h3>Robot Takeover</h3>
  <p>Not quite as frightening as a Vampire Takeover or Living-Dead
  Takeover, a robot rebellion is still a disquieting thought. We are
  already outnumbered by our technological gadgets, and even Bill Gates
  fears the day his Japanese robot slave turns him over by the ankles
  and asks (in a suitably robotic voice) "Who's your daddy now?"

    We don't know how the universe started, so we can't be sure it won't just end, maybe today.

  <h3>Unexplained Singularity</h3>
  <p>We don't know how the universe started, so we can't be sure it won't
  just end, maybe today, and maybe with nothing more exciting than a
  puff of anti-matter and a slight fizzing noise.</p>

  <h3>Runaway Climate Change</h3>
  <p>Dismissed by some, Al Gore's prophecy of doom may still come true. If
  it does, we may have to contend with vicious storms, widespread food
  shortages, and surly air conditioning repairmen.</p>

  <h3>Global Epidemic</h3>
  <p>Some time in the future, a lethal virus could strike. Predictions
  differ about the source of the disease, but candidates include
  monkeys in the African jungle, bioterrorists, birds and pigs with the
  flu, warriors from the future, an alien race, hospitals that use too
  many antibiotics, vampires, the CIA, and unwashed brussel sprouts.
  Whatever the source, it's clearly bad news.</p>
